# Python_IPL_2023_Data_Analysis
This is a complete Data Analysis Project using Python. I have utilised Pandas, Numpy and Plotly Libraries to complete this project.
Original Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aravindas01/ipl-2023-data
As the github performs a static render of the notebooks and it doesn't include the embedded HTML/JavaScript that makes up a plotly graph, the Visuals in this Notebook won't be appearing.
To see the visuals in this notebook paste the link of this notebook: https://github.com/Sanjib22/Python_IPL_2023_Data_Analysis/blob/main/IPL%202023%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb in https://nbviewer.org/ which will show all the visuals present in the notebook.
